=========================
1. Edited Solidity file to start PatientId from '2' because its less messy 
    compared to editing the init files with their references.
2. Shifted query commands from createPatient.js into app.js instead
    Reason: Had to first use contract.CALL method to retrieve patientId.
            Then, using that PatientId insert it into DB. But, DB has its own constraints,
            so i need to make sure it inserts into DB before i createPatient on Blockchain.
            Or else, we will need a new method to unCreatePatient, which will create a whole
            new mess.
