=========================
1. Edited Solidity file to start PatientId from '2' because its less messy 
    compared to editing the init files with their references.
2. Shifted query commands from createPatient.js into app.js instead
    Reason: Had to first use contract.CALL method to retrieve patientId.
            Then, using that PatientId insert it into DB. But, DB has its own constraints,
            so i need to make sure it inserts into DB before i createPatient on Blockchain.
            Or else, we will need a new method to unCreatePatient, which will create a whole
            new mess.

=======================
1. Finished up Create Request by students to merge with Request contract
    a. Calculated the score based on # of indications left to be completed before graduation [0.3 Weightage], 
        Seniority [0.5 Weightage], First Come First Serve [0.2 Weightage]
    b. After request is created, I updated the current student with the highest scoring request for this particular patient into the DB.
        So that it can be displayed when viewing this patient by other students / staff while it is still being listed, before allocation.

2. Updated the front end to display current highest scoring student. 
    So that students know where they stand, if they are likely to get this patient.

3. Edited allocatePatient.js as it is retrieveing REQUESTS when it should be retrieving Patients to be allocated.
